# Mobile Apps Project Food Delivery Application Hanying
This project was performed by myself for graduating a course from the 4th Semester, Data Visualization. I created a Tableau story on "Analyzing the Impact of Motor Vehicle Ownership on Carbon Emissions in ASEAN" to answer 3 stated problems. The story includes 3 dashboards with different visuals to represent the current situation of motor vehicle ownership in ASEAN and the carbon emission that has been poluted by years.
