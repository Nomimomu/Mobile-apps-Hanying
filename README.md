# Mobile Apps Project Food Delivery Application Hanying
<H6 align="justify">
This project was developed by myself, along with my team, as part of the 4th-semester course on Mobile Apps. We created a mobile application called Hanying, a food ordering platform designed to enhance the user experience in browsing, selecting, and ordering food. The app addresses several key features through various interfaces. It includes a Splash Screen, Login and Registration Pages, a Main Menu to explore food categories and popular items, and a Menu Page featuring various types of food. Users can access detailed information on selected items through the Detail Menu, locate offline branches via the Map Location page, and make secure payments on the Payment Page. The Profile Page organizes user details for easy navigation.
